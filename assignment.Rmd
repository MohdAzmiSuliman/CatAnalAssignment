write.csv(dataset,'dataset.csv')
```

### Data Exploration
```{r, warning=F}
anads0 <- read_csv("dataset.csv", col_types = cols(`Body mass index` = col_skip(),
                                                   X1 = col_skip()))
head(anads0)
```

Data Cleaning

1. remove missing value
2. remove underweight (BMI < 18.5) and very high BMI (BMI >80).
3. select only those with known dylipidaemia status (yes/no)

# Ordinal Logistic Regression

To determine which factors (or predictors) that associated with HbA1c target, ordinal logistic regression (cumulative logit model) will be use. The factors include BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol level, dyslipidaemia status, gender and age.

## Univariable

Univariable analysis was done to determine association between each predictor with HbA1c target.levels(anads1$HbA1C_Ta)

```{r}
levels(anads1$HbA1C_Ta)
```

### Predictor: BMI Category

```{r}
levels(anads1$bmic)
clm_bmic <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ bmic, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_bmic, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lccccccc")
```
&nbsp;
Interpretation: 

1. BMI category had association with higher category of HbA1c target group.
2. The odd of overweight BMI being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above is `r round(exp(coef(clm_bmic)[3]), 2)` higher (95% CI: 1.10, 1.46, p = 0.036) than a normal BMI.
3. The odd of obese being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above is  `r round(exp(coef(clm_bmic)[4]), 2)` higher (95% CI: 1.30, 1.71, p = 0.036) than a normal BMI. 

### Predictor: Waist Circumference

```{r}
clm_wc <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ wc, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_wc, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lccccccc")
```
&nbsp;
Interpretation: 

1. Higher waist circumference associates with higher category of HbA1c target group.
2. For each increase of 1 cm of waist circumference, the log odds of being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above was `r round(coef(clm_wc)[3], 4)`, which correspond increase of odd of `r round(exp(coef(clm_wc)[3]), 4)` times higher.
3. For each increase of 10 cm of waist circumference, the log odds of being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above was `r round(coef(clm_wc)[3]*10, 4)`, which correspond increase of odd of `r round(exp(coef(clm_wc)[3]*10), 3)` times higher


### Predictor: Total Cholesterol Level

```{r}
clm_tc <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ tc, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_tc, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lccccccc")
```
&nbsp;
Interpretation: 

1. Higher total cholesterol level associates with higher category of HbA1c target group.
2. For each increase of 1 mmol/L of total cholesterol level, the log odds of being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above was `r round(coef(clm_tc)[3], 2)`, which correspond increase of odd of `r round(exp(coef(clm_tc)[3]), 2)` times higher.
3. For each increase of 10 mmol/L of total cholesterol level, the log odds of being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above was `r round(coef(clm_tc)[3]*10, 2)`, which correspond increase of odd of `r round(exp(coef(clm_tc)[3]*10), 2)` times higher


### Predictor: Age

```{r}
clm_age <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ Age, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_age, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lccccccc")
```
&nbsp;
Interpretation: 

1. Higher age associates with lower category of HbA1c target group.
2. For each increase of 1 year of age, the log odds of being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above was `r round(coef(clm_age)[3], 2)`, which correspond to odd of `r round(exp(coef(clm_age)[3]), 2)` times.
3. For each increase of 10 year of age, the log odds of being in category of target HbA1c $\leqslant$ 6.5 or above was `r round(coef(clm_age)[3]*10, 2)`, which correspond to odd of `r round(exp(coef(clm_age)[3]*10), 2)` times.


### Predictor: Gender

```{r}
levels(anads1$gender)
clm_gender <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ gender, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_gender, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lccccccc")
```
&nbsp;
Interpretation: 

1. Gender had no association with higher category of HbA1c target group.

### Predictor: Dyslipidaemia Status

```{r}
levels(anads1$dyslpd)
clm_dyslipid <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ dyslpd, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_dyslipid, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lccccccc")
```
&nbsp;
Interpretation:

1. Dyslipidaemia status had no association with higher category of HbA1c target group.



## Multivariable

For multivariable analysis, several independent variables were identified and included in the preliminary main effect models.

### Preliminary Main Effect Models

#### Model 1

For preliminary main effect model 1, independent variables that included were **BMI category**, **waist circumference**, **total cholesterol level**, **dyslipidaemia status**, **gender** and **age**.

```{r}
clm_mod1 <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ bmic + wc + tc + dyslpd + gender + Age, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_mod1, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lcccc")
```

#### Model 2

For preliminary main effect model 2, predictor **waist circumference** was removed

```{r}
clm_mod2 <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ bmic + tc + dyslpd + gender + Age, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_mod2, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lcccc")
```

#### Model 3

For preliminary main effect model 3, predictor **waist circumference** and **BMI Category** was removed

```{r}
clm_mod3 <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ tc + dyslpd + gender + Age, data = anads1)
kable(tidy(clm_mod3, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lcccc")
```

### Model comparison

All three preliminary models were compared using LR test

```{r, warning=F}
anova(clm_mod1, clm_mod2)
anova(clm_mod2, clm_mod3)
```

Interpretation: waist circumference can be remove but BMI category was an important predictor.

### Interaction

There are two interaction that possibly may affect the model, which include

1. gender and total cholesterol level
2. gender and BMI category

#### Interaction between gender and total cholesterol level

Gender and total cholesterol level may have interaction because it was found that male had higher total cholesterol level as compared to female [t-test (df) = 9.45 (5,179.9), p < 0.001]

```{r}
t.test(anads1$tc ~ anads1$gender)
clm_mod2ia <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ bmic + tc + dyslpd + gender + Age + gender:tc, data = anads1)
anova(clm_mod2, clm_mod2ia)
```

Interpretation: interaction between gender and total cholesterol level was not significant.

#### Interaction beween gender and BMI category

Gender and BMI category may have interaction because it was significant different [$\chi^2$(df) = 20.67 (2), p < 0.001]

```{r}
ctable(anads1$bmic, anads1$gender)
chisq.test(anads1$bmic, anads1$gender)
clm_mod2ib <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ bmic + tc + dyslpd + gender + Age + gender:bmic, data = anads1)
anova(clm_mod2, clm_mod2ib)
```

Interpretation: interaction between gender and BMI category was not significant

### Assumption checking - Proportional odds assumption

One of assumption in ordinal logistic regression, which is proportional odds assumption was checked for numerical variables, which includes

1. total cholesterol level
2. age

```{r}
nominal_test(clm_mod2)
```

Interpretation: 

1. Proportional odds assumption for total cholesterol level variable was violated.
2. Proportional odds assumption for age variable was violated

Since assumption for proportionality was violated, cholesterol level and age was categorized.

```{r}
anads2 <- anads1 %>% 
  mutate(tcc = cut(tc, breaks = c(0, 5.2, 6.2, 14),
                   labels = c("good", "borderline", "uncontrolled")),
         agec = cut(Age, breaks = c(0,18,50,60,70,100),
                    labels = c("< 18 yo", "19 - 50 yo", "51 - 60 yo", "61 - 70 yo", "above 70 yo")))
freq(anads2$agec)
freq(anads2$tcc)
```

#### Revised Model

total cholesterol level and age variables was changed to total cholesterol category and age category variable

```{r}
clm_mod2R <- clm(HbA1C_Ta ~ bmic + tcc + dyslpd + gender + agec, data = anads2)
kable(tidy(clm_mod2R, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T), digits = 3, align = "lcccc")
```
&nbsp;
Proportional odds assumption was not tested due to none of the independent variables was numerical data.

# Final Model

In final models, it was found that variables BMI category, total cholesterol level category, dyslipidaemia status, gender and age category were significantly associated with HbA1c target level. Ordinal logistic regression was summarised in table below.

# Multinomial Logistic Regression

Another alternative for multiple level outcome analysis if proportional odds assumption was not met is by doing multinomial logistic regression. However multinomial logistic regression will not account for the ordinal level in the outcome.


```{r}
anads3 <- anads2 %>%
    mutate(HbA1C_Ta2 = cut(HbA1c, breaks = c(0, 6.5, 7.0, 20),
                         labels = c("Target a (<= 6.5)", "Target b (6.6 - 7.0)",
                                    "Target c (>7.0)")),
           HbA1C_Ta3 = fct_relevel(HbA1C_Ta2, levels = c("Target c (>7.0)", "Target b (6.6 - 7.0)", "Target a (<= 6.5)"))) %>%
    select(HbA1c, HbA1C_Ta3, Age, gender, ethniccol2, dmage, ht, wt, bmi, bmic, wc, tc, dyslpd)

```

## Multinomial Logistic Regression Model

The ordinal logistic regression model was reanalyse using multinomial logistic regression. the variables include

1. Outcome: HbA1c target group (i.e. Target A, Target B or Target C)
2. Predictors : **BMI category**, **waist circumference**, **total cholesterol level**, **dyslipidaemia status**, **gender** and **age**

```{r}
levels(anads3$HbA1C_Ta3)
mulnommod0 <- vglm(HbA1C_Ta3 ~ bmic + tc + dyslpd + gender + Age, multinomial, data = anads3)
summary(mulnommod0)
```

The result of analysis was summarised in table below

```{r}
result_mulnommod0 <- matrix(c("BMI (Category)", "", "", "", "", "", "", "",
                              "", "Normal", 0, "", "", 1, "", "",
